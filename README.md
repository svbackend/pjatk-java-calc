Simple JavaFX calculator with reverse polish notation

### Plan

1. UI - 0-9, +, -, *, /, text field with current expression, section for result, button to get the result
2. Event listeners - when user clicks on button we need to update text field with current expression
3. ... Will add futher checkpoints after research about reverse polish notation. Probably I will need to parse input string into tokens and then implement algorythm which will use these tokens as input and return a calculated result.
